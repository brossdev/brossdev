<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

<p align="center">I worked in finance for around 14 years before I quit my job and joined
          a coding bootcamp to learn how to code in September 2016. Iâ€™ve worked
          in various roles in the tech industry from a Junior Developer in a
          Digital Agency to a Tech Lead in a SASS startup.</p>
